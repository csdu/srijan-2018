  p Srijan means creation. Srijan is the annual magazine of Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi. It is launched every year at Sankalan.
  p Srijan started with an aim to capture the tremendous advancements in technology and lay out a bigger picture in a few words. Since then, we have been trying to capture and highlight what happened in the past year and what lies ahead. Srijan aims at giving a complete roundup of the emerging tech within the field of computer science. Magazine also includes some ART, as we believe programming is an ART. And one who can program is an Artist at heart.
  p The theme for this year's srijan is CES 2018. CES is huge, and it matters. 
  p CES or the Consumer Electronics Show is the most significant annual trade show across the globe. It is organized by the Consumer Technology Association in Las Vegas. CES usually have about twice the number of attendees than Mobile World Congress. CES has evolved to show us that what seems awkward and “for rich, lazy people” one year, becomes reasonable, practical, and available to everyone seemingly overnight. CES is all about showing us how everyday life will get better next year or the year later. CES encompasses and touches the concepts of upcoming technologies which ultimately ends in the homes of the bourgeoisie.
  p A few major topics which covered in CES 2018 include Smart Home Devices: Alexa, Google Home & other voice assistants. Convertible Laptops, Companion Robots, Virtual Reality, 5G Technology, Health Sensors, and many more.
